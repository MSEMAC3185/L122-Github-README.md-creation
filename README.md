# This is a new README file.
## The First of Its Kind.
This is made for **learning how to use README files** and Marckdown as well. Good training and practice!!.

To create a ***README.md*** file, I use the following command:
```
touch README.md
```
Then...
```
git commit -am"add README.md file"
```
